IN-ANALYSIS BOARD
Analysis: Disaster Fatalities over Time
 
Observations
1.	Monthly fatalities range between 3.48M and 3.89M.
2.	February records the lowest fatalities (3.48M), followed by April (3.49M) and June (3.50M).
3.	July records the highest fatalities (3.89M), followed by October (3.8M) and August (3.7M).
4.	Fatalities remain relatively stable in Q1 (3.6M–3.67M).
5.	Slight decline in Q2 (3.49M average).
6.	Sharp peak in Q3 (July–August).
7.	Q4 fatalities fluctuate between 3.6M–3.8M.
Insights
•	Fatalities fluctuate seasonally, indicating that disaster occurrence or severity varies across months.
•	The significant peaks in July and October suggest seasonal drivers, possibly linked to climatic or environmental cycles.
•	The narrow range of fatalities across months shows that disasters occur consistently throughout the year, not confined to one season.
•	The stability in Q1 followed by a sharp rise in Q3 implies mid-year environmental or meteorological shifts may influence disaster severity.
•	Persistent high monthly fatalities point to globally sustained disaster exposure rather than isolated regional events.

Analysis: Disaster Fatalities by Location
 
Observations
1.	Brazil records the highest fatalities (7.71M).
2.	Fatalities across countries range between 6.94M (China) and 7.71M (Brazil).
3.	Top three countries: Brazil (7.71M), Indonesia (7.40M), and India (7.37M).
4.	China records the lowest fatalities (~10% lower than Brazil).
5.	Fatal impacts are global and not region-specific.
Insights
1.	The small variation in fatalities among countries (6.94M–7.71M) suggests disasters have a widespread global impact rather than regional concentration.
2.	Brazil’s leading fatalities indicate higher disaster exposure or population vulnerability.
3.	Similar fatality levels in Asia and South America show that both developed and developing regions face comparable disaster risks.
4.	China’s relatively lower fatalities despite high disaster frequency may reflect stronger response capacity or better infrastructure.
5.	Cross-continental uniformity in high fatality counts indicates shared global vulnerability patterns.

Analysis: Disaster Type by Economic Loss
 
Observations
1.	Earthquakes caused the largest losses ($896B), followed closely by floods ($895B).
2.	Tornadoes ($889B), wildfires ($879B), and hurricanes ($866B) follow closely behind.
3.	Economic losses are fairly evenly distributed, with a narrow gap of $30B across disaster types.
Insights:
1.	The close economic loss figures across disaster types suggest that all hazards contribute almost equally to total global losses.
2.	Earthquakes and floods drive the largest share of financial damages, confirming their dual role as both frequent and high-impact hazards.
3.	The narrow loss range implies that mitigation gaps exist across all disaster types, not just one.
4.	High losses from tornadoes and wildfires reflect growing exposure of urban and rural economies to climate-related hazards.
5.	Economic impacts are relatively evenly distributed, highlighting that no single hazard dominates global financial risk.

Analysis: Economic Loss by Location
 
Observations
1.	Brazil recorded the highest economic loss ($767.13B).
2.	USA recorded the lowest ($722.86B), though differences among countries are minimal (~6%).
3.	Total annual loss across all six countries = $4.43 trillion.
4.	Economic impacts are widespread across continents.
Insights
1.	The minimal difference in losses across countries (about 6%) shows that economic exposure to disasters is universally high.
2.	Brazil’s top losses correspond with its high fatality count, suggesting that high-impact disasters there affect both life and economy.
3.	The USA’s lowest loss, though still substantial, may reflect stronger resilience or insurance systems.
4.	Asia’s concentration of mid-to-high losses demonstrates that the region bears a major share of global disaster costs.
5.	The $4.43 trillion total loss underscores the global economic burden of natural disasters within a single year.

Analysis: Disaster Type by Magnitude
 
Observations
1.	Earthquakes have the highest average magnitude (10,088.77).
2.	Wildfires (9,820.35) and floods (9,807.42) follow closely.
3.	Tornadoes (9,761.63) and hurricanes (9,407.69) are slightly lower.
Insights
1.	All disaster types exhibit high magnitudes, indicating that 2024 was marked by globally severe events.
2.	Earthquakes lead in magnitude, reinforcing their reputation as the most intense natural hazard.
3.	Wildfires and floods show near-equal magnitude, suggesting similar destructive capacity despite differing mechanisms.
4.	The small magnitude gap between the highest and lowest types points to overall intensification of global disasters.
5.	Disaster severity levels are converging, implying that non-traditional hazards (e.g., wildfires) are becoming as strong as classic ones like earthquakes.


Analysis: Disaster Occurrence per Country
 
Observations
1.	Brazil experienced the highest number of disasters (1,743).
2.	China recorded the fewest (1,637).
3.	Frequency of disasters is relatively similar across all countries.
Insights :
1.	The close frequency range (1,637–1,743 events) shows that all countries experienced similar disaster occurrence levels.
2.	Brazil’s high frequency aligns with its top fatalities, confirming that repeated exposure amplifies mortality risk.
3.	China’s lower event count but high fatalities suggests that fewer but more severe disasters occur there.
4.	The narrow variation across nations indicates that global environmental and climatic factors drive widespread disaster activity.
5.	Frequency distribution consistency implies a shared global hazard environment rather than isolated national phenomena.


Analysis: Disaster Magnitude by Location
 
Observations
1.	Brazil has the highest disaster magnitude share (17.60%).
2.	Japan (16.86%) and India (16.70%) follow.
3.	China records the lowest (15.98%), though differences are minimal.
Insights
1.	The near-uniform magnitude percentages (15.98%–17.60%) show that all countries face comparable disaster intensities.
2.	Brazil’s highest magnitude share reinforces its position as the most disaster-burdened nation in 2024.
3.	Japan and India’s high magnitudes reflect their geographic exposure to seismic and climatic extremes.
4.	China’s lower magnitude despite high fatalities indicates secondary factors (e.g., population density, preparedness gaps) influence outcomes.
5.	The small spread in magnitudes across countries highlights that disaster severity is a global challenge rather than region-specific.

CONCLUSION
The analysis reveals that natural disasters in 2024 had widespread human and economic impacts, with countries like Brazil, Indonesia, and India experiencing the highest fatalities and losses across multiple disaster types. Tornadoes, floods, and earthquakes emerged as the most destructive hazards, underscoring the urgent need for stronger infrastructure, early-warning systems, and risk financing mechanisms. Overall, enhancing global collaboration, investing in preventive measures, and promoting community resilience are essential to reducing future disaster impacts and strengthening preparedness worldwide.
